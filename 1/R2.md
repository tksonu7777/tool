To create a Python application that identifies vulnerabilities in specified systems (.NET, Java, Eclipse, Android Studio, and iOS), we can use a simple command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to select a system and then simulates the process of checking for vulnerabilities.

For the purpose of this example, we'll create a basic structure that outlines how you might implement this functionality. In a real-world scenario, you would integrate with actual vulnerability scanning tools or APIs.

Here's a sample code:
```py
import sys

# A dictionary to simulate vulnerability data for each system
vulnerabilities = {
    "dotnet": ["CVE-2021-34527", "CVE-2020-0601"],
    "java": ["CVE-2021-22945", "CVE-2021-22947"],
    "eclipse": ["CVE-2021-22950"],
    "android_studio": ["CVE-2021-22951", "CVE-2021-22952"],
    "ios": ["CVE-2021-30860", "CVE-2021-30858"]
}

def display_vulnerabilities(system):
    """Display vulnerabilities for the selected system."""
    if system in vulnerabilities:
        print(f"Vulnerabilities for {system.capitalize()}:")
        for vuln in vulnerabilities[system]:
            print(f"- {vuln}")
    else:
        print("No vulnerabilities found for the selected system.")

def main():
    """Main function to run the vulnerability identification application."""
    print("Welcome to the Vulnerability Identification Tool")
    print("Please select a system to check for vulnerabilities:")
    print("1. .NET")
    print("2. Java")
    print("3. Eclipse")
    print("4. Android Studio")
    print("5. iOS")
    
    # Get user input
    choice = input("Enter the number corresponding to your choice: ")
    
    # Map user choice to system name
    systems = {
        "1": "dotnet",
        "2": "java",
        "3": "eclipse",
        "4": "android_studio",
        "5": "ios"
    }
    
    # Check if the choice is valid
    if choice in systems:
        selected_system = systems[choice]
        display_vulnerabilities(selected_system)
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please select a valid option.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Explanation of the Code:
Vulnerability Data: A dictionary named vulnerabilities is created to simulate known vulnerabilities for each system. In a real application, this data could be fetched from a database or an API.

Function display_vulnerabilities: This function takes a system name as input and prints the associated vulnerabilities. If the system is not found, it informs the user.

Main Function: The main function provides a simple CLI for the user to select a system. It maps user input to the corresponding system name and calls the display_vulnerabilities function.

User Input Handling: The program checks if the user's choice is valid and responds accordingly.

Execution: The script runs the main function when executed directly.

This code serves as a basic framework for a vulnerability identification tool. In a production environment, you would replace the simulated data with actual vulnerability scanning logic.
