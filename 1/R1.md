PS-1: Enhancing Cybersecurity with Targeted Vulnerability Prevention
Problem:
Delivering robust and secure software solutions requires actively addressing the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and other common security threats. As the cybersecurity landscape evolves, ensuring that all potential vulnerabilities are effectively identified, mitigated, and resolved remains an ongoing challenge. While existing security measures and processes are typically in place, continually adapting to new and emerging threats demands enhanced vigilance and continuous improvement. The dynamic nature of software development, coupled with the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, makes it crucial for organizations to consistently strengthen their ability to detect, address, and prevent vulnerabilities in code, ensuring compliance with industry standards and the protection of sensitive data.

Goal:
Develop tools/techniques/processes that can automatically detect and flag the specified OWASP top 10, SANS top 25, business logic vulnerabilities, and other emerging threats within the application system during the development cycle
The application systems for which vulnerabilities need to be identified should be .Net, Java, Eclipse, Android Studio, and IOS.
Key Challenges:
Selecting the right tools and techniques for detecting the specified vulnerabilities.
Seamlessly integrating these tools into development and deployment workflows.
Ensuring that the vulnerability detection process is accurate, has no / less false positives, and is effective.
Balancing security requirements with the need for efficient development and delivery
List of Vulnerabilities to Address: OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25, business logic vulnerabilities, and other emerging threats within the application system. As a participant, you are encouraged to choose as many vulnerabilities as possible and provide remediation for them.

- eg 



```py
import requests

def scan_application(url):
    # Start a new scanning session
    session_url = "http://localhost:8080/JSON/newSession/"
    response = requests.get(session_url)
    session_id = response.json()['scan']
    
    # Set the target URL for scanning
    target_url = f"http://localhost:8080/JSON/core/action/scan/?zapapiformat=JSON&url={url}&apikey=your_api_key&session={session_id}"
    requests.get(target_url)
    
    # Wait for the scan to complete
    while True:
        status_url = f"http://localhost:8080/JSON/core/view/status/?zapapiformat=JSON&apikey=your_api_key&session={session_id}"
        response = requests.get(status_url)
        status = response.json()['status']
        
        if status == '100':
            break
    
    # Get the scan results
    alerts_url = f"http://localhost:8080/JSON/core/view/alerts/?zapapiformat=JSON&apikey=your_api_key&baseurl={url}&session={session_id}"
    response = requests.get(alerts_url)
    
    # Process and display the vulnerabilities
    vulnerabilities = response.json()['alerts']
    
    for vulnerability in vulnerabilities:
        print(f"Vulnerability: {vulnerability['name']}")
        print(f"Risk Level: {vulnerability['risk']}")
        print(f"Description: {vulnerability['description']}")
        print("-----")

```

- In this example, we are using the OWASP ZAP API to scan a target application for vulnerabilities. You will need to replace http://localhost:8080 with the actual URL of your OWASP ZAP instance and your_api_key with your API key.

- To use this code, you can call the scan_application(url) function and pass the URL of the application you want to scan. The tool will start a scanning session, wait for the scan to complete, and then display the detected vulnerabilities.

- Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to customize it based on your specific requirements and integrate additional vulnerability detection techniques or tools.
